# Project for SIXT test task

```
Please create a list of offers from that endpoint:
https://content.sixt.io/codingtasks/offers.json
 
The work should be done with react/redux and uploaded to a git repo of your choice. As we do not have a proper cross origin header for that endpoint please use something like the Moesif CORS Plugin for development.
 
1. the offers should be displayed in a responsive grid, each offer-tile should have a square format. Fullsize would maybe result in 4 tiles per row, mobile view would have only two tiles per row.
 
2. the offers should be sortable by the options in the key ‚sortIndexes‘
 
Design may be done roughly, just to show the responsive behaviour. Offers should display only name, image and a price.
```

<!-- 
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
